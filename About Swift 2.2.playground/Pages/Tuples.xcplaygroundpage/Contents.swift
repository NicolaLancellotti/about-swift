 # Comparison Operators
 
 You can also compare tuples that have the same number of values, as long as each of the values in the tuple can be compared.
 
 Tuples are compared from left to right, one value at a time, until the comparison finds two values that arenâ€™t equal. If all the elements are equal, then the tuples themselves are equal.
 
 The Swift standard library includes tuple comparison operators for tuples with less than seven elements. To compare tuples with seven or more elements, you must implement the comparison operators yourself.

(4, "dog") == (4, "dog")      // true because 4 is equal to 4, and "dog" is equal to "dog"
