 - Oniguruma
 - ICU
 - .NET

^   # Matches at the very start of the input string, or the start of a line when
    # in multi-line mode
$   # Matches at the very end of the input string, or the end of a line when in
    # multi-line mode
\A  # Matches at the very start of the input string
\Z  # Matches at the very end of the input string, in addition to before a
    # newline at the very end of the input string
\z  # Like \Z, but only matches at the very end of the input string
\G  # Like \A, but also matches against the start position of where matching
    # resumes in global matching mode (e.g \Gab matches twice in abab, \Aab
    # would only match once)
# \c <Char>: A control character sequence, which denotes a scalar
    # from U+00 - U+7F depending on the ASCII character provided
\b  # Matches a boundary between a word character and a non-word character
\B  # Matches a non-word-boundary
\y  # Matches a text segment boundary, the definition of which varies based on
    # the y{w} and y{g} matching option
\Y  # Matches a non-text-segment-boundary
/#
//: ## Escape sequences

\a    # The alert (bell) character U+7
