 Use the type check operator (`is`) to check whether an instanceAny is of a
 certain subclass type. The type check operator returns true if the instanceAny
 is of that subclass type and false if it is not.

 ## Casting
 
 * Use the conditional form of the type cast operator (`as?`) when you are not
 sure if the downcast will succeed. This form of the operator will always return
 an optional value, and the value will be nil if the downcast was not possible.
 This enables you to check for a successful downcast.
 * Use the forced form of the type cast operator (`as!`) only when you are sure
 that the downcast will always succeed. This form of the operator will trigger a
 runtime error if you try to downcast to an incorrect class type.

 * `Any` can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types.

 discover the specific type of a constant or variable that is known only to be
 of type `Any` or `AnyObject`.

 ### Switch
 
 In a switch statement, a value is cast to a type only when pattern matching
 with that type succeeds. For that reason, you use the as operator instead of
 the conditional as? or unconditional as! operators.

 - note:
 As a performance optimization, an unconditional downcast of a collection to a
 collection with a more specific type, such as NSArray as! [NSView], may defer
 type checking of each element until they are individually accessed. As a
 result, an unconditional downcast to an incompatible type may appear to
 succeed, until a type cast failure of an element triggers a runtime error.
 \

 A conditional typecast of a collection to a collection with a more specific
 type, such as NSArray as? [NSView], will perform type checking of each element
 immediately, and return nil if a type cast failure occurs for any element.
