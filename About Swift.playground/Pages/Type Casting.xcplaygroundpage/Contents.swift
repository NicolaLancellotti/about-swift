 Use the type check operator (is) to check whether an instance is of a certain subclass type. The type check operator returns true if the instance is of that subclass type and false if it is not.

 ## Casting
 
 * Use the conditional form of the type cast operator (as?) when you are not sure if the downcast will succeed. This form of the operator will always return an optional value, and the value will be nil if the downcast was not possible. This enables you to check for a successful downcast.
 
 * Use the forced form of the type cast operator (as!) only when you are sure that the downcast will always succeed. This form of the operator will trigger a runtime error if you try to downcast to an incorrect class type.

/*:
 ## Type Casting for Any and AnyObject
 * AnyObject can represent an instance of any class type.
 * Any can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types.
 
 You can use the is and as operators in a switch statementâ€™s cases to discover the specific type of a constant or variable that is known only to be of type Any or AnyObject.

 ### Switch
 In a switch statement, a value is cast to a type only when pattern matching with that type succeeds. For that reason, you use the as operator instead of the conditional as? or unconditional as! operators.

 - note:
 As a performance optimization, an unconditional downcast of a collection to a collection with a more specific type, such as NSArray as! [NSView], may defer type checking of each element until they are individually accessed. As a result, an unconditional downcast to an incompatible type may appear to succeed, until a type cast failure of an element triggers a runtime error.
 \
 \
 A conditional typecast of a collection to a collection with a more specific type, such as NSArray as? [NSView], will perform type checking of each element immediately, and return nil if a type cast failure occurs for any element.
