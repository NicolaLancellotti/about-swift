 A string delimited by extended delimiters is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks and a balanced set of one or more number signs (#)
 You can place a string literal within extended delimiters to include special characters in a string without invoking their effect.
 If you need the special effects of a character in a string literal, match the number of number signs (#) within the string following the escape character (\\)
